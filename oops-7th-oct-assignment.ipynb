    "\n",
    "This Python program defines a class ToDoList that represents a to-do list. The class has three main methods: add_task(), mark_as_completed(), and display_pending_tasks(), along with an __init__ method for initializing the task list.\n",

    "\n",
    "This method initializes an empty list tasks when a new ToDoList object is created.\n",
    "add_task(self, task, due_date) method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to add a new task to the ToDo list.\n",
    "It takes two parameters: task (the description of the task) and due_date (the deadline for the task).\n",
    "The method creates a dictionary containing the task, due date, and a flag completed set to False indicating the task is not yet completed.\n",
    "The dictionary is then appended to the tasks list.\n",
    "The method prints a confirmation message with the task details.\n",
    "mark_as_completed(self, task) method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to mark a task as completed.\n",
    "It takes the task parameter (the description of the task) that you want to mark as completed.\n",
    "The method iterates through the tasks in the tasks list. If it finds a task matching the input task, it sets the completed flag to True indicating the task is completed.\n",
    "It prints a message confirming that the task has been marked as completed.\n",
    "display_pending_tasks(self) method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method displays all pending tasks, i.e., tasks that are not yet completed.\n",
    "It iterates through the tasks list and prints the tasks that have the completed flag set to False.\n",
    "If a task is not completed, it prints the task description and due date.\n",
    "Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program demonstrates the usage of the ToDoList class.\n",
    "It creates a todo_list object and adds two tasks: \"Finish report\" with a due date of \"2023-10-20\" and \"Buy groceries\" with a due date of \"2023-10-22\".\n",
    "It then marks the task \"Finish report\" as completed.\n",
    "Finally, it displays the pending tasks, which in this case is only the task \"Buy groceries\".\n",
    "In summary, this program provides a simple implementation of a to-do list where tasks can be added, marked as completed, and displayed. The class encapsulates the behavior of a to-do list, making it easy to manage tasks in a structured way.\n",
